<ul type="square">
<li>improve living conditions</li><br>
<li>improve food security</li><br>
<li>give farmers a chance to toil their own lands</li><br>
<li>give farmers priviledge to feed/support their families</li><br>
<li>help reduce rural-urban migration by creating employment in the farms</li><br>
</ul>


We want to bring back agriculture back to its core.As Green lands foundation, we believe that health starts with nutrition thus We ensure food security by developing ays of growing food that will work in the future so that millions of people don't go hungry.
Most farmershave given up on their overgrazed lands which are not producing quality foods anymore so we help reinforce ther lands and making the lands fertile again worthy for cultivation,
Agriculture has its place in the economic growth of many nations.Failure to improve and support agriculture has led to many who depended on their farms unable to feed their own homes
and thats why we chose to unite families by giving each family a chance to be fed by their own toil and make it count. The congestion in urban centres is being caused by individuals 
looking for jobs but if we make their farming productive again, they get the chance to employ themselves and other thus reducing the rural-urban migration</p>
